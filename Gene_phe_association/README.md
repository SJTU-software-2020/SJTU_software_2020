# Gene_phe_association

## 1. data description
* GenePAV table：Mutations at different genetic loci in different species of rice
* phenotype data：
    - rice_453_flag_leaf_angle.phe
    - rice_453_grain_length.phe
    - rice_453_grain_weight.phe
    - rice_453_grain_width.phe
    - rice_453_height.phe
    - rice_453_leaf_angle.phe
    - rice_453_leaf_length.phe
    - rice_453_leaf_width.phe
    
## 2. aim
Our main objective is to find the genes most relevant to a specific phenotype through the analysis of mutation data and phenotypic data associations.
